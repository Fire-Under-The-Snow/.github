## Tashi Delek, Fellow Tibetan Developer, Designer and Content Writer ðŸ‘‹
A little bit about FUS (Fire Under the Snow)<br/>
Fire Under the Snow resemble the burning ember of the Tibetan where snow depict the Land where we are from.<br/>
FUS is created solely to promote opensource Development to the <b>Tibetan community </b> <br/>
We see a current gap between the Tibetan Devs with the rest of the world and we are here to change it.<br/>
this Organization is a place for the fellow Tibetan Developers to be a part of a greater cause. <br/>
A place to learn about git, prs, CI/CD and many more.<br/>
let together bring a change as it is said, "A Fire under the Snow"<br/>

## Note
if you are a Tibetan Developer and want to be a part of the FUS, Feel free to raise an Issue and we will ping you up
